For creating the webpage for URLs shortener, I used Laravel8 and VueJS2. Laravel and VueJS are totally two separte project.
Laravel is for server side and VueJS is for client side.

To run the project, follow the few step

1. Run laravel app with 8000 port. If you use another port, please also change in VueJS baseURL(main.ts).
   .sql file attached. Please check .env file for db name or credentials.
2. Run VueJS with
   $ npm run serve
3. Login with following credentials 
   Email : admin@gmail.com
   Password : Bangla71
   After login, click  "Go to shortener URL" link or hit /urls route.
4. + icon is for generate Shortener URL.
5. To check the redirect from short to original url -> copy the short link and hit the browser.

This project recognize the duplicate URL and show as toast message if already generate.
URL must in 6 symbols which contains alphanumeric symbols.
URL didn't checked with Google Safe Browsing API.

Thanks
